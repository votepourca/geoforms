Local Democracy Forms and Tools based on ClojureScript Reagent (react.js) and Matchbox (firebase) app for local democracy

This is Alpha software.


## What's inside

This is mainly a ClojureScript application that includes:
* [Reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent) - ClojureScript interface to Facebook's React
* [reagent-forms](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent-forms) - data binding library for Reagent
* [Matchbox](https://github.com/crisptrutski/matchbox) - a Firebase client for Clojure(Script)

It also has a clojure backend for now (but might be removed) and Heroku facilities for deployment.
